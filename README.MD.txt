SELF EVALUATION
some very unexpected things that went wrong:
struggling with transform.position and using the vector2. I kept trying to model my code off of what I previously learned in block breaker, 
I kept trying to overcomplicate it and kept misunderstanding te importance of declaring its Vector2. I spent way too many hours on moving the car left and right. next time I would look at my old code, but start from fresh instead 
of trying to backward engineer it


I struggled with making my objects spawn using Ienumerator and startcoroutine. this took the bulk of my time, the syntax was very confusing and I kept running into problems with the function itslef, my issue being that it was creating
an infinite loop it was stuck on. I never thought that that was the problem, as when i checked my task manager it seemed to be just fine, I thought it could have been some misunderstanding of the function causing my unity to slow and crash.
Next time instead of trying to understand the function itslef I would maybe try to see it applied  to other code online. Also next time I will not rule solutions/problems out until I forsure know, for example not ruling my code being stuck 
just because my pc build is a beast (it was infinitly stuck)

I also struggled with creating the function for displaying score and multiplying the gamespeed, my problem with that was I accidentally was calling the wrong field name, which was still running just fine but messing
with my other function for object spawning, which took me some time to figure out. Next time I would avoid this by making my variable names painstakingly obvious.


the biggest factor to me falling behind schedule would be how long I took to finish the 4th credit, I took long to udnerstand from the video and then apply it myself, I think I didnt learn too much more than if I were to just grind it
from the start, however it took me long to finish credit 4 also because of my tardiness in the first 3 credits. aside from that, I struggled hard with finding solutions to my errors, especially the first two. It should be a world record
the time I spent working on those lines of codes. next time I would have people I can find support from or send me in the right direction, as apposed to just grinding forums I dont understand. another option would have been to abondon
the method and find another way.

If I were to start over from the start I would most importantly concentrate the planning moreso on the revolving aspects rather than the main function, and find support if I struggle with the main functions. what I mean by this is
when I found I needed extra support for the object spawning, I should have right away moved onto other things like  that dont directly invole it.

Anything else that you'd like your teacher to know and something you'd like to explain that might help you earn back grades?
If I knew that I would have had an extra day, I would not have wasted it (no sleep + ramadan) did me no good. this definitly doesnt change anything in terms of my project, but maybe if there are any marks in terms of quality/time spent
that matters.
